# VehicleRentalHub

Welcome to VehicleRentalHub! ðŸš—ðŸ”§

This project is part of a coding assignment that involves creating a vehicle rental system. Below, you'll find information on the assignment, the technology stack, and instructions for Windows 10 users.

## Assignment

The goal of this project is to design an API for a frontend application that collects user information and data about vehicles to rent, along with rental dates. The project involves the use of Node.js, a chosen framework (Nest.js preferred), an SQL database, and validation libraries.

### Instructions

- [x] Seed initial data into the database.
- [x] Create necessary APIs for the frontend.
- [x] Design a submit API to receive relevant data for booking a vehicle.

### Points to Note

- Make validation checks on the backend wherever necessary.
- Implement appropriate error handling.
- Using Docker is a plus.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **Nest.js**: Framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.
- **SQL Database**: Store and manage data.
- **Validation Library**: Ensure data integrity.

## Instructions for Windows 10 Users

If you are using Windows 10 for development, consider the following:

### Line Endings Warning

- If you encounter Git warnings about line endings, create a `.gitattributes` file with the following content:
